```js
// sequence length is 3
[1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3] // input

## Installing

```
npm install keep-sequences-stream
```


## Usage

`keepSequencesStream([length], [comparator])`

`keepSequencesStream(‚Ä¶)` returns a [duplex stream](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_duplex) [in object mode](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_object_mode).

Default `length` is `3`. Default `comparator` is [`===`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comparison_Operators#Identity).

### Example

```js
const keepSequencesStream = require('keep-sequences-stream')

let s = keepSequencesStream(2)
s.on('data', console.log)

for (let x of [3, -1, -1, 2, -1]) s.write(x)
// `-1` will be logged twice
```
